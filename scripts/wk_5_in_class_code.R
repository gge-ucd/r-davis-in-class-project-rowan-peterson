#Using the iris data frame (this is built in to R), create a new variable that categorizes petal length into three groups:

#small (less than or equal to the 1st quartile)
#medium (between the 1st and 3rd quartiles)
#large (greater than or equal to the 3rd quartile)

#Hint: Explore the iris data using summary(iris$Petal.Length), to see the petal length distribution. Then use your function of choice: ifelse() or case_when() to make a new variable named petal.length.cat based on the conditions listed above. Note that in the iris data frame there are no NAs, so we donâ€™t have to deal with them here
